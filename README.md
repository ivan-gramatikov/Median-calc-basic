# Median-calc-basic

Data structure for median
Write a data structure that supports two operations.

1. Adding a number to the structure.

2. Calculating the median.

The solution can be in any language, but there are things we value:

1. Written in C++ (CMake for build system).

2.  Well-structured code. Easy to read and understand.

3. There are automatic tests.

4. Hosted on  github.com (or  bitbucket.com, or  gitlab.com).

5. The operations to add a number and calculate the median have a minimum time complexity.


Adding a number to the structure and calculating the median are clear requirements and at the same time
are open to a myriad of implementation interpretations.

Hence, the programming of language of choice is Python and the internal data storage types as well as
standard library functions have been chosen to perform the task.

The reason behind this is that they have been optimized for speed and simplicity of use as well, of course, as maximal
readability of the code itself.

Usage:

`python3 median.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10` 

and 

for the automated tests phase:

`python3 test_median.py`
